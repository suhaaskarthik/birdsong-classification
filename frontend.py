**Birds are excellent indicators of biodiversity change** due to their mobility and diverse habitat needs. Shifts in bird populations can signal the success or failure of ecological restoration.

üö´ **Traditional surveys** are expensive and logistically tough to scale.

üéôÔ∏è **Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM)**, when paired with **machine learning**, enables efficient biodiversity monitoring across large regions and over time.

üåø **The Western Ghats**, a UNESCO-listed Global Biodiversity Hotspot, hosts unique birdlife found nowhere else on Earth. But it's under threat from landscape and climate changes.
